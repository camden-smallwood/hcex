# HCEX

This is an in-progress decompilation of Halo: Combat Evolved. It's primarily based on the July 28, 2011 HCEX_Release binary, but will reference other builds on other platforms (such as PC, Original Xbox, MacOS) in order to cover more features. It's heavily tailored by hand, with some sensible refactorings to ease it into being cross platform code. Feel free to make some suggestions.
